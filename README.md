# Application test

## Introduction

The goal of this test is to create a peer to peer application to send binary data from one browser tab to another, using the RTCDataChannel of the WebRTC HTML5 API.

WebRTC is an API that allows direct browser-to-browser communication. It's widely used for video chats, but it can be used for many other things, including peer-to-peer video delivery like we do at Streamroot.
